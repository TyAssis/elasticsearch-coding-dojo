## Objective of the Week

Develop advanced skills in building complex queries and performing aggregations in Elasticsearch. Participants will learn how to extract meaningful insights and conduct deep data analysis.

## Proposed Problem

Context: A company wants to optimize its recruitment process. To do this, it needs to better understand the characteristics and trends among applicants.

## Challenge of the Week

Use complex queries and aggregations in Elasticsearch to extract insights about the pool of candidates. This may include identifying the most common skills, analyzing the geographic distribution of candidates, or determining which work experiences are most prevalent.

Queries:

- How many candidates speak each listed language?
- What is the average years of experience among all candidates?
- Identify candidates who have worked at "DuBuque LLC" between 2008 and 2020.
- What are the most common companies in the candidates' work history?
- What is the average age of the candidates?
- What is the correlation between years of experience and number of certifications?
- How has the average years of experience of the candidates changed over the years?

## Expected Outcome:

- Ability to build complex queries that answer specific questions about candidate data.
- Ability to perform aggregations that provide a clear view of recruitment data trends and characteristics.
- Develop a report or dashboard that synthesizes insights obtained through queries and aggregations.

## Theoretical Content:

Building Complex Queries:

- Explore the use of bool, range, match, multi-match, and full-text search queries.
- Aggregations in Elasticsearch:
  - Understand how to perform aggregations to summarize data, such as counts, averages, minimums, and maximums.
- Explore types of aggregations such as bucket, metric, matrix, and pipeline.
